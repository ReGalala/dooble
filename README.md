# dooble

> **Find things to do around you.**

Dooble is a web app that connects visitors with local activities and helps activity organizers manage their offerings. Visitors can explore activities on an interactive map, view details, and get tickets — while organizers can create, edit, and track their activities through a dedicated dashboard.

This project was developed with **[Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev)**.

## 🎓 GitHub Pages Demo

This repository has been converted into a **static frontend-only demo** specifically for teacher review. All backend dependencies have been removed or mocked, allowing the app to run completely in the browser without any server or database.

### Demo Credentials

You can test both user roles using the following pre-configured credentials:

- **Normal Visitor:**
  - **Email:** `funny@email.com`
  - **Password:** `123456`
- **Activity Provider:**
  - **Email:** `mail@chalmers.com`
  - **Password:** `123456`

### Mocked Features

Since this is a static demo:
- **Authentication:** Mocked locally. Logins and signups update the browser's `localStorage` state instead of calling a real backend.
- **Data Persistence:** Activities, tickets, and user accounts are persisted only in your local browser storage. If you clear your site data or use a private window, it will reset.
- **Images/Uploads:** Image uploads are mocked using temporary object URLs.
- **Database:** Supabase Auth, Storage, and MongoDB have all been decoupled.

### Deployment & URL

The application automatically deploys to GitHub Pages via a GitHub Actions workflow when changes are pushed to `main`/`master`.

**The live static demo can be accessed at:**
